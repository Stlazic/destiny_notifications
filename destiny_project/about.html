            <p>Thank you for using Destiny Notifications. My friend heard Ada was selling shaders starting in Lightfall and decided that running over to her secluded area was too much work. Instead he did the only normal thing a Destiny 2 player would do and found a way to play the game less. He wrote a Python script that would text him whenever Ada sold a shader he didn't own. Then he decided to expand to Xur, Banshee, and Finally Tess. He can't write a bit of JavaScript or CSS to save his life though, so he asked me to make this website for him and I even got to use it as a final project for one of my classes. Anyway, we hope this will help you get all those shaders you missed before the great sunset tragedy of 2020. We all know shaders are more valuable than any exotic. Again, thank you for using this app, I hope it helps. See you later guardian. </p>
